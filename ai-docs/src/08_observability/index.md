## Observability

Effect has built-in support for structured logging, distributed tracing, and
metrics. For exporting telemetry, use the lightweight Otlp modules from
`effect/unstable/observability` in new projects, or use
`@effect/opentelemetry` NodeSdk when integrating with an existing OpenTelemetry
setup.
